The trader is following greedy algorithm:
- randomly find a pair of tokens that are currently not aligned to the market price
- trade the pair of price so that it aligns to the market price:
    + Assume that the difference between the traded quantity and optimal quantity of 1 trader follow the normal distribution N(0, 1)
               => the difference between the traded quantity and optimal quantity of n traders follow the normal distribution N(0, n)
    
- Do the same loop until the price converges to market price
